# Project Name: Nobel Prize Winners Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Nobel Prize winners. It involves data cleansing, data processing, data analysis, and visualizing graphs. The main objective of this project is to identify patterns and insights related to Nobel Prize winners, including their demographics, research organizations, and achievements.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes information on Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016. The data was sourced from the Nobel Prize website and includes details such as name, birth date, birth country, award category, research organization, and other relevant information.

## Tools and Technologies Used
The following tools and technologies were used for this project:
- Python programming language
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Numpy library for numerical computations
- Seaborn library for data visualization
- Plotly library for interactive visualizations

## Methodology
The data cleansing process involved identifying and dealing with missing values, outliers, and incorrect or inconsistent data. Data processing entailed transforming, combining, and aggregating data to generate new information. For example, the data was grouped by various categories, such as birth country and award category, to generate summary statistics.

Data analysis involved identifying patterns and insights from the processed data. For example, the data was analyzed to identify the countries with the highest number of Nobel Prize winners and the most common research organizations associated with Nobel Prize winners.

Finally, several graphs were produced based on the newly processed data. These included pie charts, bar plots, line plots, linear regression, Chloropleth maps, Sunburst chart, and Raceplots.

## Results
The analysis of the Nobel Prize winners dataset revealed several interesting insights, including:
- The United States has produced the highest number of Nobel Prize winners, followed by the United Kingdom and Germany.
- The most common research organization associated with Nobel Prize winners is the University of California, followed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
- The average age of Nobel Prize winners is around 59 years.
- There is a positive correlation between the age of Nobel Prize winners and the year they received the prize.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in identifying patterns and insights related to Nobel Prize winners. The results can be used to inform further research on the demographics and achievements of Nobel Prize winners.
